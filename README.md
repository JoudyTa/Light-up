This game involves a table with cells of varying sizes. Some cells are shaded and labeled "B," while others have numbers (such as "B1") or letters (such as "L" or "D") to indicate their properties.

The objective of the game is to place light bulbs in certain cells to illuminate all the unshaded cells. The number in each cell indicates how many bulbs can be placed vertically or horizontally around it. Bulbs can be placed in any unshaded cell, even if it has a number or letter next to it.



Each bulb illuminates the cells in its row and column up to the nearest wall or boundary. However, bulbs should not be placed in cells that already contain a bulb, and there should not be more than one bulb in a row or column.



The game comes to a conclusion when all the cells without shading are lit up, ensuring that every single cell is illuminated by the end.

Here are two strategies for solving the puzzle:

Strategy 1: Look for walls that follow the number 4. If the number 4 is present, add four lights around the cell.



Strategy 2: Identify the places where the light needs to be dimmed and mark them as "x.".
